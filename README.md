# Python Hello World Project with Pytest
This is a simple Python project demonstrating how to use `pytest` for testing Python code. The project contains:
1) `hello.py` - A module with a single `greet` function that creates a customized greeting message.
2) `test_hello.py` - tests the greeting functionality of the `greet` function

This project serves as a minimal example of writing and testing Python code using `pytest`.
